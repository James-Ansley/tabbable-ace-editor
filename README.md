# Tabbable Ace Editor

Small example of tabbable Ace editors.

Sites can be tabbed through normally. However, whenever a 
[react-ace](https://github.com/securingsincity/react-ace) component
is interacted with either by clicking on it or typing while the
editor is focused, tabs will then indent or dedent the code.
This can be escaped by clicking off the editor or by pressing
the escape key at which point tabs can be used to navigate
the page.
